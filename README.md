# UCLA Bootcamp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help students in the bootcamp to get ready for the first day of class. 
My motivation for this project was learning about HTML, CSS, Git, and JS.
I built this project to practice my skills after learning about HTML, CSS, Git, and JS.
Although this does not solve any problems, I can refer to this Study Guide in the future as a reference.
