        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Inside the head element, we can use the following metadata tags: title, stlye, base, link, meta, and script</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt, &lth4&gt, &lth5&gt, and &lth6&gt elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>he &ltp&gt element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The &ltul&gt, &ltol&gt, and &ltp&gt elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The &ltimg&gt element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. </li>
          <li>The &ltbr&gt element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>Speaking of the hyperlink, the &lta&gt element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>In the preceding statement, a &ltlink&gt element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html). To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.</li>
          <li>style.css file is linked within the &lthead&gt element</li>

          <li>git add -A: add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage). The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit: commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>
          <li>git push [alias] [branch]: transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>script.js file is linked within the &ltbody&gt element.</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write.</li>
          <li>We define topics AFTER we tell the computer to log it in the console.</li>
          <li>When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
            <ul>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</ul>
            <ul>The second statement is the condition.</ul>
            <ul>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</ul>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
